# ML Practice: Arm Distribution or Actions
Practicing Machine Learning by creating a distribution reward matrix with normally distributed rewards with a small variance that is ideal with normal distribution rewards and simulating the data using R language.

## Creating the Matrix Being Used
Instead of finding a dataset to use, I am creating my own matrix that starts with 3, increasing the number by 1.5 until we have 10 numbers. After, I created the reward distribution before preparing my data simulation. See screenshot.

I then viewed my dataset to make sure it was clean and correct for my simulation. I only took a screenshot of the first 13 rows, it does have 10,000 lines with various outcomes.
